# Ask The DM
## D&D Alexa Skill
### Version 0.1

### Alex Gaesser 2017

Ask the DM is a quick-reference tool designed for use during Dungeons and Dragons play sessions. The skill provides spell descriptions to players through a voice-command interface.

This is my first Alexa skill, and borrows heavily from [Amazon's How-to template skill.](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto)
